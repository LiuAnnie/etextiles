        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p style="width: 80%">
            I crafted a speaker using conductive fabric! In the video demonstration above, my speaker is playing the audio from my video 
            artwork, 

            <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Nqt538KRy9E" style="color: deeppink">
                THIS IS THE DIGITAL AGE (AND EVERYTHING IS F*CKING ONLINE), 2021
            </a>.
        
        </p>

        <p style="width: 80%">
            To make this speaker, I connected the audio amplifier to the 9V battery and audio jack by soldering. I then applied 
            iron-on adhesive onto the conductive fabric, laser-cut a coil pattern out of the fabric, and then ironed the coil pattern onto 
            a non-conductive fabric. After soldering two wires onto the two ends of the coil and connecting these ends to the audio amplifier, 
            the speaker was complete! I placed a magnet under the coil, plugged the audio jack to a device, and was able to play music out of 
            the hand-crafted speaker.
        </p>

        
        <p style="width: 80%">
            I'm surprised at how simple this was to achieve, and I feel inspired to create more works that include hand-crafted speakers. I especially 
            like how the speaker isn't too loud which forces the listener to get closer to the speaker. The act of leaning in to hear more clearly feels 
            intimate. 
        </p>

        <p style="width: 80%">
            In the future, I'd like to experiment with creating hand-crafted speakers of varying sizes and possibly crafting a sweater covered in speakers.

        <h2>Circuit</h2>
        <p style="width: 80%">
            The circuit is achieved with the coil-shaped conductive fabric, an audio amplifier, audio jack,  9V battery, wire, and a magnet. 
            When the audio jack is plugged in, the speaker works successfully!

        <p style="width: 80%">
            I learned how to craft this speaker while in class, but Kobakant has a great reference for fabric speakers!
