        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p style="width: 80%">
            Using thermochromic pigments, I was able to create a dynamically changing fabric actuator.

        </p>

        <p style="width: 80%">
            Thermochromic pigment becomes colorless when heat is applied. By mixing this pigment with paint and applying
            this
            paint on textiles, we're able to produce a dynamic textile that changes color when heat is applied. One way
            to apply heat is to place
            the dynamic textile over another textile or surface that can change temperature. Another way is to sew
            conductive thread through
            the areas we want to apply heat to and run current through the thread, which heats it up. This is simple to
            achieve, and
            my favorite quality of the thermochromic pigment is that it behaves similarly to memory foam. Memory foam
            bounces back into its
            original shape once pressure is removed, similarly, the thermochromic pigment appears colorful again after
            the heat dissipates.
        </p>

        <p style="width: 80%">
            If I were to implement the thermochromic pigment in an artwork, I would use it on a mounted canvas painting
            or wearable that discusses
            fleeting memories and the impact people have on us. How do our interactions with others impact us in that
            moment? How have the people I met shaped
            the person I was in the past, who I am now, and who I will be in the future? What do I remember from those
            interactions? What memories stay? What do
            we do to hold onto the people and the memories from the past?

            I learned how to craft this dynamic textile while in class, but Kobakant has a reference for using
            thermochromic dyes.
