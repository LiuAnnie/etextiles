        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p style="width: 80%">
            g.loves is a pair of gloves that light up when holding hands. Intended for two participants, each
            participant wears a glove and when the palms meet, the gloves illuminate.
        </p>

        <p style="width: 80%">
            My interest in modes of human connection is what motivated this project. I wanted the action of switching 
            the circuit on to be meaningful in that aspect. I considered making masks that illuminated if two participants 
            kissed through their masks. I ultimately settled on hand-holding for this project. To keep this first prototype simple, 
            the interation is holding hands to activate the circuit. However in the future, I'm interested in how these gloves can act 
            as an ambient display for our emotions prior to any human interaction and as a real-time display when we interact with others. 
            Some wearables that I drew inspiration from include the

        <h2>Circuit</h2>
        <p style="width: 80%">
            The first prototype of this LED wearable utilizes 2 LED sequins, conductive thread, conductive tape, and
            a coin cell battery. I created a pocket to hold the coin cell battery, which is located on the right-hand
            glove at the wrist. The switch to turn the circuit on/off is at the palms of each glove. The conductive tape
            on
            the left-hand glove connects the two strips of conductive tape on the right-hand glove, completing the
            circuit.

        <h2>Future Iterations</h2>
        <p style="width: 80%">
            In the future, I'd like to:
        </p>
        <p style="width: 80%">
            - make the gloves myself (for this first prototype, I used what I already had as a canvas)
            <br>
            - apply LEDs on both gloves (ran out of conductive thread the night I made the first prototype and couldn't
            sew LEDs onto the other glove)
            <br>
            - use conductive fabric as the switch instead of conductive tape
            <br>
            - consider the use of a microcontroller to animate the lights
            <br>
        </p>
